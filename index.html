                            We study submodular optimization problems where the goal is to maximize utility while minimizing cost, and move beyond traditional approaches that return only a single solution with a fixed tradeoff.
                            We develop efficient algorithms to compute approximate Pareto frontiers, providing representative solutions 
                            that expose the full spectrum of achievable utility–cost tradeoffs in applications such as recommender systems, influence maximization, and team formation.

                            In many data-mining applications, including recommender systems, influence maximization, and team formation, the goal is to pick a subset of elements
                            (e.g., items, nodes in a network, experts to perform a task) to maximize a monotone submodular utility function while simultaneously minimizing a cost
                            function. Classical formulations model this tradeoff via cardinality or knapsack constraints, or by combining utility and cost into a single weighted
                            objective. However, such approaches require committing to a specific tradeoff in advance and return only a single solution, offering limited insight into the
                            space of viable utility-cost tradeoffs. In this paper, we depart from the single-solution paradigm and examine the problem of computing representative
                            sets of high-quality solutions that expose different tradeoffs between submodular utility and cost. For this, we introduce
                            $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-approximate Pareto frontiers that provably approximate the achievable tradeoffs between submodular utility and cost. Specifically, we
                            formalize the Pareto-$\langle f,c \rangle$ problem and develop efficient algorithms for multiple instantiations arising from different combinations of
                            submodular utility $f$ and cost functions $c$. Our results offer a principled and practical framework for understanding and exploiting utility-cost tradeoffs
                            in submodular optimization. Experiments on datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate that our algorithms efficiently compute approximate Pareto
                            frontiers in practice.

                            We introduce a unified QUBO-based formulation for team formation that jointly optimizes skill coverage and expert cost across multiple cost definitions.
                            Our approach achieves performance comparable to established methods and enables transfer learning via graph neural networks that learn reusable expert and skill representations

                            The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills.
                            The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs
                            associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions.
                            We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage
                            and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained
                            binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the
                            QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that
                            QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning,
                            allowing node embeddings from one problem to be applied to another.

                                Modern financial analytics rely on high-volume streams of event notifications that report live market fluctuations based on supply and demand.
                                Accurately identifying trends or breakout patterns based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the development of an instrument's price early on
                                is an important challenge, so as to buy while the price is low and sell before a downtrend begins. This paper aims to solve the above challenge with a
                                distributed, event-streaming solution built using Apache Flink. We present and implement a solution that leverages customized window operators to calculate
                                the EMA and find breakout patterns, using event generation parallelism to facilitate the rapid processing of the input stream uses sinks to collect and output
                                results, and scales easily on a distributed Flink cluster. We empirically test our design on metrics specified by the benchmarking platform for the
                                DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge and observe a throughput of 45 batches per second and an average latency of 120 ms.

                                in the 2016 presidential election, by mining transportation patterns of US residents from March 2020 to July 2020. To ensure a fair comparison, we first
                                use a K-means clustering method to group the 50 states into five clusters according to their population, area and population density.
                                We then characterize daily transportation patterns of the residents of different states using the mean percentage of residents traveling and the
                                number of trips per person. We also use temperature data to attempt to explain the difference in the way residents travel and practice safety measures.

                                of my research was to design a computational system that could follow live musical performances and display pre-encoded lyrics in real-time. I implemented a multi-threaded audio framework with a shared synchronous buffer to
                                handle simultaneous recording and processing. I extracted chroma feature vectors from the waveform audio data and then used online dynamic time warping to align the live audio stream with a pre-annotated version of the audio
                                based on their harmonic similarity, and display lyrics in real-time.
