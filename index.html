                        I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://midas.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Massive Data & Algorithms (MiDAS)</a> research group at BU, 
                        advised by <a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/evimaria/" target="_blank">Dr. Evimaria Terzi</a>. My research interests are primarily focused 
                        on algorithmic data mining and computational social science problems. My current research is on designing efficient approximation algorithms 
                        for submodular optimization problems, specifically the Team Formation problem.
                        <!--<br><br> My broader research interests are shaped by the diversity of my past experiences: I am excited about all things statistical, algorithmic and game theoretic. I am 
                        interested in studying about optimality and efficient strategies in environments of incomplete and imperfect information. I am curious about using machine learning 
                        and data-driven methods to formulate a better understanding of social systems.-->

                        at the intersection of business and tech. 
                        <!--I developed a bid-price optimization engine in Python, where I used hierarchical clustering and logistic model trees to build 
                        a microservice to handle real-time pricing requests. I also helped automate pre-surgical authorization for patients using natural language processing on clinical data.-->
                        <!-- Prior to IBM I studied Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester, NY, and explored a variety of topics

                        <h3>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</h3> </h3>
                        <p>
                            The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. 
                            The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs 
                            associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. 
                            We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage 
                            and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained 
                            binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the 
                            QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. 
                            Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and 
                            skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem to be applied to another.

                        <p>
                            We deviate from the classic team formation problem setting where one is asking to cover all skills of each 
                            given task; instead we aim to cover as many skills as possible while also trying to minimize the maximum workload among the experts. 
                            We also consider a variant of this problem, where the experts are organized into a graph, which encodes how well they work together. 
                            Utilizing such a coordination graph, we aim to find teams to assign to tasks such that each team's radius does not 
                            exceed a given threshold. We develop a generic template algorithm for approximating both problems in polynomial time, and 
                            we show that our template algorithm has provable guarantees. We describe a set of computational speedups that we can 
                            apply to our algorithms and make them scale for reasonably large datasets. From the practical point of view, we demonstrate 
                            how to efficiently tune the two parts of the objective and tailor their importance to a particular application. 
                            Our experiments with a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation as well as the 
                            efficiency of our algorithms in practice.

                        <p>
                            Recommendation algorithms for social media feeds often function as black boxes from the perspective of users. We aim to detect whether social media feed 
                            recommendations are personalized to users, and we also aim to characterize the extent and factors contributing to personalization in these feeds. We introduce a 
                            general framework to examine a set of social media feed recommendations for a user as a temporal graph. We label vertices in the graph as the result of 
                            exploration vs. exploitation of the user’s interests on the part of the recommendation algorithm and introduce a set of metrics to capture the extent of personalization 
                            across user timelines. We apply our framework to a real TikTok dataset and validate our results using a baseline dataset generated from automated TikTok 
                            bots, as well as a randomized baseline. We also investigate the extent to which factors such as video viewing duration, liking, and following drive the 
                            personalization of content on TikTok. Our results demonstrate that our framework produces intuitive and explainable results, and can be used to audit and 
                            understand personalization in social media feeds.

                        <p>
                            In the classical team-formation problem the goal is to identify a team of experts such that the skills of these experts cover all the skills required by a given task.
                            We deviate from this setting and propose a variant of the classical problem in which we aim to cover the skills of every task as well as possible, 
                            while also trying to minimize the maximum workload among the experts. Instead of setting the coverage constraint and minimizing the maximum load, we combine these two objectives into one. 
                            We call the corresponding assignment problem the Balanced Coverage problem, and show that it is NP-hard. We adopt a weaker notion of approximation and we show that under this notion we 
                            can design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with provable guarantees.
                            We also describe a set of computational speedups that we can apply to the algorithm and make it scale for reasonably large datasets. 
                            From the practical point of view, we demonstrate how the nature of the objective function allows us to efficiently tune the two parts of the objective and 
                            tailor their importance to a particular application. Our experiments with a variety of real datasets demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation as 
                            well as the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithm in practice.

                        <p>
                            Modern financial analytics rely on high-volume streams of event notifications that report live market fluctuations based on supply and demand. 
                            Accurately identifying trends or breakout patterns based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the development of an instrument’s price early on 
                            is an important challenge, so as to buy while the price is low and sell before a downtrend begins. This paper aims to solve the above challenge with a 
                            distributed, event-streaming solution built using Apache Flink. We present and implement a solution that leverages customized window operators to calculate 
                            the EMA and find breakout patterns, using event generation parallelism to facilitate the rapid processing of the input stream uses sinks to collect and output 
                            results, and scales easily on a distributed Flink cluster. We empirically test our design on metrics specified by the benchmarking platform for the 
                            DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge and observe a throughput of 45 batches per second and an average latency of 120 ms.

                            We investigate the difference in the spread of COVID-19 between the states won by Donald Trump (Red) and the states won by Hillary Clinton (Blue) 
                            in the 2016 presidential election, by mining transportation patterns of US residents from March 2020 to July 2020. To ensure a fair comparison, we first 
                            use a K-means clustering method to group the 50 states into five clusters according to their population, area and population density. 
                            We then characterize daily transportation patterns of the residents of different states using the mean percentage of residents traveling and the 
                            number of trips per person. We also use temperature data to attempt to explain the difference in the way residents travel and practice safety measures.

                            I was awarded a research fellowship by Xerox to conduct research under the guidance of
                            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pJmAoJ4AAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Zhiyao Duan</a> in the Audio Information Research Lab at the University of Rochester during the summer of 2016. The primary purpose
                            of my research was to design a computational system that could follow live musical performances and display pre-encoded lyrics in real-time. I implemented a multi-threaded audio framework with a shared synchronous buffer to
                            handle simultaneous recording and processing. I extracted chroma feature vectors from the waveform audio data and then used online dynamic time warping to align the live audio stream with a pre-annotated version of the audio
                            based on their harmonic similarity, and display lyrics in real-time.
